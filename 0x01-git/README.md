## _0x01-git_



[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!

- Inside 0x01-git:
    - 
    - Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
    - Create these empty files:
    - c/c_is_fun.c
    - js/main.js
    - js/index.js
    - Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
    - Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"
    -OOB Add all these new files to git
    - Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
